# 💻 Hackers & UFOs

_This is the history of hackers looking for evidence of UFOs._ &#x20;

### **Early Cases: "Quentin" and Mathew Bevan**

* **1992** "Quentin" of [Project Green Cheese / Project ALF-1](http://phrack.org/issues/42/13.html#article)  \
  from Phrack Magazine Issue 42, File 13. (The E-zine prints IP addresses of US secret networks.) Use _CTRL+F_ to find _'Text File'_ for the relevant part.\
  Here's [some commentary](http://cd.textfiles.com/secretsubjects/UNDERGRD/VOL\_5/CUD513D.TXT) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20060903065207/http://paul.rutgers.edu/\~mcgrew/ufo/hackers)).  \
  [**1992** Dateline NBC segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0QflNaPi7A\&feature=youtu.be\&t=2m15s)--Quentin is interviewed with other hackers.  \
  [**1994** Columns in UFO Magazine by T. Scott Crain](1994-ufo-magazines.md), who wrote to NBC.\
  **2019** [article about the segment by Nick Redfern](https://web.archive.org/web/20221130210136/https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2019/11/ufos-computer-hacking-the-media-just-maybe-dead-aliens/), which includes the quote: &#x20;

> _"The hacker is aware of the interest his apparent UFO data has provoked, but does not wish to respond."_ - the late Susan Adams (Dateline NBC producer)

Quentin's true identity remains unknown.

*   **1994** [Mathew 'Kuji' Bevan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew\_Bevan)\
    Inspired by the articles in Phrack, (and a rumor about Project Green Cheese being a group of 40 hackers who went missing,) Bevan used a Commodore Amiga 500 and 1200 to penetrate the US Air Force, NASA, and NATO.\
    **1996** Bevan is arrested [and considered an accomplice of Richard 'Datastream Cowboy' Pryce](https://irp.fas.org/congress/1996\_hr/s960605b.htm), but Bevan is let off 18 months later due to lack of evidence. (The US was unwilling to share their evidence with a UK court.) &#x20;

    Bevan's case was covered extensively in the [media](http://www.kujimedia.com/musings/), [periodicals](http://www.kujimedia.com/gallery/), and [other](http://web.archive.org/web/20030306080356/http://www.wasc.noaa.gov/wrso/security\_guide/hacking.htm) online [sources](http://web.archive.org/web/19990508120956/http://www.soci.niu.edu/\~crypt/other/afosi.htm).  \
    **1997** [Times of London article](https://web.archive.org/web/20001214002200/http://www.ufomind.com/ufo/updates/1997/nov/m24-016.shtml) when released.\
    **1999** [Interview of Bevan by Matthew Williams](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/secret\_projects/project159.htm)

> _“Possibly the single biggest threat to world peace since Adolf Hitler.” -_ a Pentagon source

> _“Nearly started a third world war.”_ - Jim Christy, AFOSI

Technical details about Bevan's hack are discussed in [this Twitter thread by @hackerfantastic](https://web.archive.org/web/20220519145556/https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/1527301954208092160).

Of note is that he got into a Wright-Patterson Air Force Base system that took no password and [saw plans for an antigravity drive](https://web.archive.org/web/20010306071223/http://www.artgomperz.com/a1998/jan/wpafb.html): &#x20;

> In getting into that there was one machine on the network where I read current files and future project proposals. I read documents which gave me the impression that they had an anti-gravity engine which was capable of at least Mach 12 to Mach 15. I don't know how exactly how fast that is but I think that is faster than most aircraft we know of today. Supposedly the aircraft which employs this engine uses a reactor to which there were a lot of detailed numbers and figures for, but I have no idea what all this meant. I can remember that the documents referred to a super heavy element, whatever that means. The element is the main fuel for the reactor. The engine worked by making a disturbance of molecules at the front of the craft so that it was able to stop the inertia or G-force inside the craft. I got the impression that this information was the type of material I was looking for because it was far in advance of our current technology and could be something to do with the Roswell UFO. Finding this threw me because I didn't know if this information was a disinformation exercise and that people were meant to get in and find this stuff or if it was real. I can't be sure and this is the one annoying thing. &#x20;

Bevan also says, &#x20;

> I like to think what I saw was not misinformation. &#x20;

### **Most Well-Known: Gary McKinnon**

**2001-2002** [Gary 'SOLO' McKinnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary\_McKinnon), the most well-known UFO hacker, breaks into US Army, US Navy, US Air Force, Department of Defense, and NASA computers by targeting systems with administrator passwords of "Administrator," "password," or blank. Gary accomplishes this using a Perl program to mass scan a /16 IP space and probe the NetBIOS protocol on port 139. He uses a 56K dial-up modem. On some systems, he installs RemotelyAnywhere for remote desktop. He uses Landsearch software to search through all files on all computers across a domain. On a Navy system, he sees spreadsheet tabs with titles such as "non-terrestrial officers" and "fleet-to-fleet transfers", with names of ships not known to be in the US Navy. Also, following Dr. Steven Greer's [Disclosure Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DrcG7VGgQU) and specifically the testimony of [Donna Hare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEBLmWhx1K0), he targets Building 8 at NASA Johnson Space Center where UFOs are reportedly being airbrushed out of satellite photography before the photos are released to the public. He makes it onto a system and sees a 'raw' photo of a smooth [cylindrical craft with domes](https://imgur.com/3ATHPFP) that has no seams or rivets. However, he miscalculates the time zones and is disconnected by a local computer user before he can take a screenshot. Months later, he is arrested by the UK's National Hi-Tech Crimes Unit (who seize his computer) and he is put under an extradition order from the US. It will be a 10-year legal battle before his extradition is finally blocked by the UK over human rights and UK charges are eventually dropped. Gary still faces [US charges](https://web.archive.org/web/20060516102803/http://cryptome.org/ips-bared.htm).

I used these same hacking techniques at around the same time, idea attributed to 'SOLO', capitaziled the same.

Thieme has given talks on other topics as well, [see a more complete index here](https://infocondb.org/presenter/richard-thieme-neuralcowboy).

Thieme also wrote a monthly column which was compiled in his book [Islands in the Clickstream](https://thiemeworks.com/words/islands-in-the-clickstream/). In the original printing, Chapter 9 "The Dark Side of the Moon and Beyond" contains columns written between **1997** and **2003**, many of which involve the UFO topic, e.g. "UFOs and the Internet" from July 8, 1997.

~~TL;DR: I gave a nervous presentation on this topic to a MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) chapter.~~\
~~You can find the~~ [~~slides here~~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/117hzGARkd8h28lUTwg-kxXBXOcq1NlQG/view?usp=sharing)~~, and here is the unedited~~ [~~video of the talk~~](https://youtu.be/oQ0E76dI4wI?t=19m33s)~~. Presentation begins 20 minutes in.~~ _The information presented in this talk is not up-to-date with my latest research. I am working on a new presentation of the information._

_Talk Errata:_ My old talk contains many errors. These include, but are not limited to: The Secret Service raid on Phrack Magazine began in 1989 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrack#Arrest\_of\_Knight\_Lightning)), and was not in response to Quentin's actions which were published later in 1992. In the Q\&A session, someone asked how long Gary was in military & NASA systems. He was inside different networks for five to seven years (according to his _The Guardian_ interview) before being arrested. He had been under observation for months, not days. He was charged for 13 months. Also, the network icon is in the lower-right system tray. (I initially got confused and said it was on the left.)
