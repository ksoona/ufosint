## Mid-'90s: Mathew Bevan

* **1994** [Mathew "Kuji" Bevan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew\_Bevan)\
  Inspired by the articles in Phrack, (and a rumor about Project Green Cheese being a group of 40 hackers who went missing,) Bevan used a Commodore Amiga 500 and 1200 to penetrate the US Air Force, NASA, and NATO.
* **1996** Bevan is arrested [and considered an accomplice of Richard "Datastream Cowboy" Pryce](https://irp.fas.org/congress/1996\_hr/s960605b.htm). However, Bevan is let off 18 months later due to lack of evidence. (The US was unwilling to provide evidence of military digital intrusion to a UK court.) &#x20;
* **1997** [Times of London article](https://web.archive.org/web/20001214002200/http://www.ufomind.com/ufo/updates/1997/nov/m24-016.shtml) when Bevan was released.
* **1999** [Interview of Bevan by Matthew Williams](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/secret\_projects/project159.htm)
* [Periodicals](http://www.kujimedia.com/gallery/), [newspapers](https://www.kujimedia.com/tag/kuji/page/4/), and [the media](http://www.kujimedia.com/musings/) covered Bevan's case extensively, along with other  sources: &#x20;

Technical details about Bevan's hack are discussed in [this Twitter thread by @hackerfantastic](https://web.archive.org/web/20220519145556/https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/1527301954208092160). He accomplished this over a USR 14.4K dial-up modem.

Of note is that he got into a Wright-Patterson Air Force Base system that took no password and [saw plans for an antigravity drive](https://web.archive.org/web/20010306071223/http://www.artgomperz.com/a1998/jan/wpafb.html): &#x20;

> In getting into that there was one machine on the network where I read current files and future project proposals. I read documents which gave me the impression that they had an anti-gravity engine which was capable of at least Mach 12 to Mach 15. I don't know how exactly how fast that is but I think that is faster than most aircraft we know of today. Supposedly the aircraft which employs this engine uses a reactor to which there were a lot of detailed numbers and figures for, but I have no idea what all this meant. I can remember that the documents referred to a super heavy element, whatever that means. The element is the main fuel for the reactor. The engine worked by making a disturbance of molecules at the front of the craft so that it was able to stop the inertia or G-force inside the craft. I got the impression that this information was the type of material I was looking for because it was far in advance of our current technology and could be something to do with the Roswell UFO. Finding this threw me because I didn't know if this information was a disinformation exercise and that people were meant to get in and find this stuff or if it was real. I can't be sure and this is the one annoying thing. &#x20;
