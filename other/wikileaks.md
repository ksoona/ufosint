  Disclosure.

# ⏳ WikiLeaks

In March 2016 the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) was targeted by Russian hackers. Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta's personal Gmail account was compromised via a spear-phishing attack. Those emails were posted on WikiLeaks in October of that year.

The hacking of the DNC has been linked to Russian Intelligence. Two groups of Russian hackers, commonly referred to as "Cozy Bear" (APT29) and "Fancy Bear" (APT28), were responsible for the breaches. These groups are associated wyth Russian intelligence agencies--the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).

## John Podesta

John Podesta was also the White House Chief of Staff under president Bill Clinton and counselor to Barack Obama. John Podesta is known to have an interest in UFOs, speaking at the Disclosure Project in 2001 and Tweeting about disclosure in 2015.

Podesta's leaked emails contain a few threads related to UFO disclosure, in particular interactions with the late astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell and Blink-182 frontman Tom DeLonge.

## Dr. Edgar Mitchell

In a series of emails spanning 2014–2015, Apollo 14 astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell persistently sought meetings with John Podesta to discuss extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI), space treaties, and peaceful space exploration, urging disclosure of government knowledge about ETI and emphasizing the need for collaboration with benevolent ETI to avoid potential conflict in space.

Before his death, emails sent on behalf of Dr. Edgar Mitchell were to set up a Skype meeting with Podesta regarding UFO disclosure, zero point energy technology, and peace in space.

## Tom Delonge

In emails from 2015–2016, musician Tom DeLonge communicated with John Podesta to discuss his efforts to advance public understanding of UFO phenomena, sharing updates on his advisory team of military and scientific experts, highlighting the role of General Neil McCasland, and seeking Podesta's support for his disclosure-focused initiatives.

Tom DeLonge set up a Google Hangout meeting with John Podesta, General Neil McCasland, and others. DeLonge discussed in emails with Podesta his advisors in the defense and intelligence communty, and laid out his multimedia UFO disclosure project, "Sekret Machines." DeLonge sent Podesta promotional images, a PDF copy of the first Sekret Machines book, and a trailer for a documentary film featuring clips of an interview with Podesta. Podesta replied directly to one of the emails that DeLonge sent him.

## Bob Fish

Podesta also corresponded with former defense contractor and program manager Bob Fish. In March 2015, Bob Fish emailed John Podesta, suggesting that UFO researchers focus on analyzing hard scientific data, such as radar and thermal imaging, collected by U.S. government programs like the Air Force's Defense Support Program satellites, to better understand unidentified aerial phenomena. Podesta responded. Read more [here](https://www.ufojoe.net/bob-fish/).
