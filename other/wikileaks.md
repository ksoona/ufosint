In 2016 the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) was targeted by Russian hackers and the emails of Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta were posted on WikiLeaks. Clinton  [John Podesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John\_Podesta)'s personal Gmail account was compromised via a spear-phishing attack.

The hacking of the DNC has been linked to Russian Intelligence. Two groups of Russian hackers, commonly referred to as "Cozy Bear" (APT29) and "Fancy Bear" (APT28), were responsible for the breaches. These groups are associated wyth Russian intelligence agencies--the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).

John Podesta was also the White House Chief of Staff under president Bill Clinton and counselor to Barack Obama. John Podesta is known to have an interest in UFOs, speaking at the Disclosure Project in 2001 and Tweeting about disclosure in 2015.

Podesta's leaked emails contain a few threads related to UFO disclosure, in particular interactions with the late astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell and Blink-182 frontman Tom DeLonge.

Before his death, emails sent on behalf of Dr. Mitchell were to set up a Skype meeting with Podesta regarding UFO disclosure, zero point energy technology, and peace in space.

Tom DeLonge set up a Google Hangout meeting with John Podesta, General Neil McCasland, and others. DeLonge discussed in emails with Podesta his advisors in the defense and intelligence communty, and laid out his multimedia UFO disclosure project, "Sekret Machines." DeLonge sent Podesta promotional images, a PDF copy of the first Sekret Machines book, and a trailer for a documentary film featuring clips of an interview with Podesta. Podesta replied directly to one of the emails that DeLonge sent him.
