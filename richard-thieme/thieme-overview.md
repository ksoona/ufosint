Thieme has given talks on other topics as well, [see a more complete index here](https://infocondb.org/presenter/richard-thieme-neuralcowboy). &#x20;

Thieme also wrote a monthly column which was compiled in his book [_Islands in the Clickstream_](https://thiemeworks.com/words/islands-in-the-clickstream/). In the original version, no longer in print, Chapter 9 "The Dark Side of the Moon and Beyond" contains columns written between **1997** and **2001** regarding UFOs. With Thieme's permission, I have republished five of these columns [here](islands-in-the-clickstream.md). &#x20;

Thieme's **2023** fiction book [_Mobius: Out of Time_](https://thiemeworks.com/words/books/mobius-out-of-time/) covers "the deft management of UFO phenomena and research in the intelligence community," among other topics. &#x20;

While an Episcopal priest, Thieme reports a fighter pilot confided in him regarding UFOs, confirming that in their fastest jets, &#x20;

> We chase them, and we can't catch them. &#x20;
