## Zero-Point Energy

In the Anomalous Coalition Q\&A with Hal Puthoff, [u/efh1 asked about Ken Shoulders](https://old.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1i56xp2/dr_hal_puthoff_hes_sort_of_like_another_tesla/), and Hal Puthoff mentioned the work of Garret Moddel. I had recently asked a Nikola Tesla expert, [Bill Beaty](https://amasci.com/freenrg/fnrg.html), about viable free energy approaches and he mentioned Moddel's work on the Casimir effect:

> I just know his [2023 conference-talk on the SSE channel on youtube](https://youtu.be/f--3HLpEbRU). A free-energy device employing silicon-fab. (By using Casmir-effect resonance in semiconductor nanolayers, he discovered a diode effect at microvolts, and so with billions of diodes wired in parallel, we can rectify thermal vibrations or even quantum ZPE, and put out microwatts with a small DC voltage.) Two videos and some papers... [https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L022007](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L022007) [https://journalofscientificexploration.org/index.php/jse/article/view/2567](https://journalofscientificexploration.org/index.php/jse/article/view/2567) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGRhTXKh8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGRhTXKh8A)\
> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddi87KVwJYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddi87KVwJYM)

Hal Puthoff also mentions the work of Bernie Haisch:\

"[On Extracting Energy from the Quantum Vacuum](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335432514_On_Extracting_Energy_from_the_Quantum_Vacuum)" and\
